# SCHOOL IS COOL
## A Poem by Aavni Harinee Garg (AHG)
   ******************************
In the class we study,

But you really want to talk to a buddy.

I love math!

Uh oh! A mouse it’s such a brat.

Look around.

What a sunny day

Everyone’s gone to play.

Basketball,football

Having fun going for a run.
